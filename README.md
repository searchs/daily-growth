# Software Engineering from Human Nutrition

Having studied Human Nutrition as a first degree, I moved into the Computer world in a developing country with no infrastructure and I think it's of the best decisions ever by a younger me!  From the inital contact to programming, I have moved from Banking to System testing, Manual testing, Automated Testing, General automation, Backend development, Frontend development, Data Engineering, Fullstack development, Blockchain development and now building AI related platforms.   This repo helps me to keep on moving in the right direction in my career.
