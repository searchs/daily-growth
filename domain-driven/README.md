# Domain Driven Design (DDD)
Domain-Driven Design is an approach for delivering software, focused on three pillars which are:
### 3 Pillars of DDD
1.  Ubiquitous language
2.  Strategic design
3.  Tactical design

_UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE_

To find, explore and capture this language, use this guide:
1. Identify key business processes, their inputs, and their outputs
2. Create a glossary of terms and definitions
3. Capture important software concepts with some kind of documentation
4. Share and expand upon the collected knowledge with the rest of the team (Developers and Domain Experts)

Event Storming (http://ziobrando.blogspot.com/2013/11/introducing-event-storming.html) is one of the techniques of improving the process of building the Ubiquitous language.

If you know your application is going to grow and is likely to change often, Domain-Driven Design will definitely help in managing the complexity and refactoring your model over time.
